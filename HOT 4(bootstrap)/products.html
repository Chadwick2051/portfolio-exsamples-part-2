              By reading this right now we are emitting waves into your brain that tell you, "you love this and will spend your money on us." In this very moment your free will is escaping your body, it will never return. You're trapped. Hope you said something nice to your loved one cause from now on all you're saying is how great these books are and that everyone really should go visit and spend money at Boring-Books-Only-dot-com. This is an inescapable truth, there is no escape from what has been unleashed unto the world. were like a zombie apocalypse but worse because you can even make an interesting tv show about it.

The text is all super faded and in old time-y cursive.
